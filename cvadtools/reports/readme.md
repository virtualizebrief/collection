_Scripts to generate reports from Citrix site related things._

# About Citrix reports

Each report generates a markdown file which is then to be copied to a documentation site that provides for clean and friendly way for others to digest the information. We use [Storehouse](https://github.com/virtualizebrief/collection/tree/main/retype), a custom deployoment of retype but you can use any markdown site or reader you enjoy.

### Example doc sites using markdown

- [x] [Docsify](https://docsify.org)
- [x] [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)
- [x] [Gitbook](https://gitbook.com)
- [x] [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org)

# Reports

> [!TIP]
> Take note of the accompanying .template file which is used in creating the markdown. This companion file could be incorporated into powershell to make it portable single file.
